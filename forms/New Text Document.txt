In forms 

 form action="" method = 'get' ></form>
    we have diffrent methods for forms like get,post etc.
    GET -> in get method the request to the server is idempotent means only the first request is transfer to the server even thogh how many times we have to refresh the page
    POST-> every request is transfered to the server


    date time local for forms -> it will set time to the user contry time ,not to the server time
         <input type="datetime-local"><br>
